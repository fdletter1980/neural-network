Multi-Branch Neural Network leveraging multi-GPU 

The purpose of the code was to handle both structured metadata around pictures (in this case mammograms) and use both image recognition and metadata using a multi-branch input and train a neural network to make a classification prediction.

To speed up the process a 2 GPU cluster was deployed to train the model.

Both training and inference code can be found here.
